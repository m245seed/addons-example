## When you change behavior (feature/fix/refactor)
- Update the relevant docs (at least `README.md`, and if needed `CONFIGURATION.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
- Maintain `moltbot_gateway/CHANGELOG.md` when user-facing or add-on behavior/options are affected.
- Consider multi-arch/build impact (`amd64`/`arm64`/`armv7`), especially in `Dockerfile` and `run.sh`.

## Commits
- Follow Conventional Commits (see `CLAUDE.md`).
- Commit messages should explain the purpose/why (not just “what”).
